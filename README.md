# Interla Conlang Project
The Interla Conlang Project aims to study the feasibility of creating a "good enough" conlang to replace english as the global language.

## Brief overview of the approach
Currently, our vision is the following:  
1. For widespread adoption, Interla should be **easy to learn** (an order of magnitude easier than english) for as much people as possible
  a. Consequently, compared to Esperanto for example, it should not be too european-centric
  b. The rules should be simple while keeping expressive power
2. For quick adoption, Interla should **unlock/provide a lot of value** from day 0
  a. Learning this language should **unlock** a lot of translated content from day 0, access to a community, ...
3. For long term retention, Interla should be **efficient**
  a. The language should be designed to diminish the impact of accents on comprehension
  b. The language should be concise, easy to understand even in noisy environnements, ...

## Brief overview of the goals of the project
Currently, the objectives are the following:  
1. Study how a conlang can be built to achieve aforementioned objectives
2. Study criterias influencing adoption of a conlang
3. Hopefully provide humanity with a more neutral and less occidento-centric language for inter-cultural communication
4. Have fun :)

## Brief overview of the organization of the project
Currently, our organization & philosophy is the following:  
1. This project is centered around a community, discussions and debate: there's nothing that can't be discussed.
2. It's designed to avoid schism: we don't want multiple concurrent version of the same language to appear, which would dilute the community.
3. The release of Interla conlang will be scheduled in waves (v0, v1, v2, ...)
4. For now, the common language that we choosed to use to discuss Interla is (ironically) english.
